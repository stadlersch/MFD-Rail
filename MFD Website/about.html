    <h4>Our Mission</h4>
    <p>As a new and genuine alternative provider of intermodal wagons &quot;fresh blood&quot;, MFD
Rail focuses exclusively on the procurement, rental and maintenance of intermodal
wagons and advises its customers and other business partners as a competent,
European acting &quot;intermodal specialist dealer&quot;.<br><br>

We are building our intermodal business on the green field using the &quot;greenfield
approach&quot;, which enables us to orient all resources such as personnel, processes
and systems exclusively to the intermodal business in order to offer the customer
&quot;intermodal-tailored&quot; services.<br><br>

The state-of-the-art systems newly procured and introduced for this purpose secure
MFD Rail&#39;s sustainable technological lead and establish MFD Rail as the most
technologically available lessor in Europe.<br><br>

The desired “data leadership” enables MFD Rail to provide modern, digital
communication with customers, suppliers and other stakeholders in a way that will
shape the industry.<br><br>

We build our business model, our business partners and our business activities in
such a way that MFD Rail as «ESG compliant», i.e. is perceived as an
environmentally friendly, social lessor with a prudent, sustainable management and
preferred lessor in the market.<br><br>

Our customer service meets the highest requirements «lessor with hightest customer
service» and represents recognizable added value through transparency, fairness,
technology and efficiency.<br><br>

The stringent focus on our core business, Intermodal, allows us to gain market
leadership in terms of scalability and efficiency «market leader in efficiency». The
scalability achieved leads to low transaction costs, &quot;cost leadership&quot;, which MFD Rail
is granted a sustainable competitive advantage and results in competitive rental
prices.<br>We will become no 2 lessor of intermodal railcars within continental Europe.</p>
